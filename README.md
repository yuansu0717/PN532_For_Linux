I try to port Linux(Linaro) to my Zedboard and program under this Embedded linux to control PN532 by UART.
Now it could read and write Mifare Card.
After compeleting this project, I decide to upload the souce files to GitHub.
Files: ser.h ser.c (Downloadded from GitHub @David Welch). His program helps me to understand how to call UART under Linux.
